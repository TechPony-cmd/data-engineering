# Learning Projects

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository is a personal collection of hands-on projects I'm working on as I learn and deepen my understanding of various technologies, tools, and frameworks in data engineering, analytics, data science, and software engineering best practices. 

Each folder contains a project built to explore a specific concept or tool â€” from building data pipelines, models, to working with cloud services, databases, and orchestration tools.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
I'm a firm believer in learning by doing. These projects are not polished products, but stepping stones â€” experiments, explorations, and notes to self â€” that help me:
- Practice new technologies
- Understand real-world data scenarios
- Build a portfolio of meaningful work

## ðŸ”§ Technologies I'm Exploring
Some of the tools and technologies featured in this repo include:
- Python & SQL
- Apache Spark
- Apache Airflow & Dagster
- dbt (data build tool)
- AWS (Lambda, S3, SES)
- Snowflake & PostgreSQL
- GitHub Actions
- Jupyter
- LookML

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Each subfolder typically includes:
- A short description of the project
- Scripts, notebooks, or configs
- README for context and learning goals
