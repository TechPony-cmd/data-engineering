# Learning Projects

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository is a personal collection of hands-on projects I'm working on as I learn and deepen my understanding of various technologies, tools, and frameworks in data engineering, analytics, data science, and software engineering best practices. 

Each folder contains a project built to explore a specific concept or tool â€” from building data pipelines, models, to working with cloud services, databases, and orchestration tools.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
I'm a firm believer in learning by doing. These projects are not polished products, but stepping stones â€” experiments, explorations, and notes to self â€” that help me:
- Practice new technologies
- Understand real-world data scenarios
- Build a portfolio of meaningful work

## ðŸ”§ Technologies I'm Exploring
Some of the tools and technologies featured in this repo include:

Current:
- Apache Spark

Incoming:
- Programming: Python, Sql
- Big Data: Spark, Kafka
- Orchestration: Apache Airflow, Dagster
- Data Modeling: dbt (data build tool)
- Cloud: GCP, AWS
- Databases: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL
- Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Each subfolder typically includes:
- A short description of the project
- Scripts, notebooks, or configs
- README for context and learning goals

ðŸ“Œ _Note: This repository is a living space for learning and may contain incomplete or evolving code._
